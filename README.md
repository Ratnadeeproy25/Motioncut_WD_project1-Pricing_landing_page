Project: Pricing Landing Page
In this project, I have shown the use of HTML CSS, and JavaScript and made a Pricing Landing page that has a tab/slider that changes among various plans along with the different currency implementations that are used using Javascript. 
Some of the design elements I have used are hover, gradient, transition, etc
